<p>So.<br>
I lied.<br>
I said I woudn’t start working on the back-end code to bring <a href="http://skimgoat.com/">SkimGoat</a> to life until after at least a week, so that I could focus on UX/UI design of the news site. The purpose of this was to fully focus on the users and their experiences first. The logic is: before cobbling up something to make the site actually functional, you should consider all factors of user engagement and system functionality. This is important for beautiful architecture.<br>
I apologize. I pretty much couldn’t help it. To the gods of beautiful architecture, please forgive my meek tendencies to experiment without regard for self-imposed rules!<br>
With all the simplification and (if I don’t say so myself) <em>becoming beauty</em> of Skimgoat, how could one not just want to make all the stories… REAL?!<br>
So, I built the core that aggregates all the news stories for different topics. I’ll open source it soon once it’s ready and I have at least 12 news sources tested on it. So far, I have NYTimes, Slate, Fox News, and Russia Today. Remember: all perspectives. It was painful doing Fox, but I made it through. Note: these new sources aren’t connected to the front-end. That will happen in the next few days, so stay tuned!<br>
BUT! We did make headway in the UX/UI. Today, I met with <a href="https://twitter.com/ykleeap">Youkyung Lee</a>, a biz/tech writer for the Associated Press, and had one of the best lunches EVER! We went over the site, and she made two valid points:<br>
1) Where is the drag and drop? Even though the <a href="http://alinapi.com/">Alina API</a> will be monitoring user activity and displaying content in order based on a user’s historical interests matched against similar users’ interests using machine learning, what if they want to manually change the order?<br>
2) What if a user wants to follow a certain writer and not just a topic? Well, this might be a bias kind of request with a journalist’s sentiment, but a request nonetheless.</p>
<p>So, as of a few minutes ago, you can drag and drop! Now, the back-end remembering your dragging and dropping placement preferences will need to be developed, but as it stands, the dragging and dropping is in the house in the latest version on SkimGoat.</p>
<p>As always, I welcome your feedback! If you have thoughts around features that could enhance the user interface of SkimGoat, don’t be shy. Reach out to me at <a href="mailto:m@alinapi.com">m@alinapi.com</a>.</p>
<p>Mike out, skimgoating away.</p>

<p>In the continued mission to enhance the front-end design of <a href="http://skimgoat.com/">SkimGoat</a>, the newborn concept news site geared towards providing multi-dimensional perspectives on different topics of interest, we simplified and <em>customizafied</em>. Customizafied is a new word which means we added customization features.<br>
So, a journalist buddy of mine, <a href="http://twitter.com/yewon">Yewon Kang</a>, was literally piiiiiisssed that we had sections for “US- Left” and “US- Right”. Why? We’ll get to that in a second.<br>
Now, the reason for these titles in the first place was to demonstrate the more conservative media outlets versus the more liberal outlets. And don’t worry… we still have that. However, she made a good point: maybe some publications are more liberal put still post certain conservative views and vice versa. Additionally, maybe some users feel an outlet is more of x, while another user thinks an outlet is more of y.<br>
And I’m not trying to piss off any journalists (not yet, at least), because according to other e-mail feedback I received earlier today, it’s been suggested that I “create a community of journalist[s] or hobbyist[s] that can have a relationship with this platform”. Therefore, I’ve been talking to journalists about how we can create a community. Why? No reason. Just going with the flow, you know. It’s not that I’m pivoting the platform in any way, but I’m always open to input. And I like talking to people, so at the very least, anything can be a fun thought experiment. And experiment is the spice of life, and neccassary to innovation…. to a degree.<br>
So being a curious guy and not truly understanding the purpose of the journalist community, it seems like a reasonable place to explore given I’m building a news site. Therefore, I’ll continue the journalistic <em>endeavorish</em> mission thang by meeting with another journalist buddy from AP for lunch tomorrow afternoon and ya know, shooting the breeze, throwing out crazy ideas. That’s also the great part about building the front-end only first… When ya build the back-end, things start being less realistic in regards to time and headaches start making limitation ever more… limited.<br>
Back to Yewon and her insights:<br>
I explained to her that one big part of this site is demonstrating all the angles. If we didn’t make that clear enough with the blinking “American Angle”, “Russian Angle”, etc… that we USED to have on the site. Yeah, that’s right. If you’ve been following the design, that portion is now gone! Haha, suckers! I know you liked it. And if you did, mobile users can still find it by looking very, very hard.<br>
I felt that the site was a little crowded and also received that input, regarding crowdedness, in unsolicited feedback this AM.<br>
So, how will people know that this service provides different angles on topics? Well, when they click on the topic, they will see the angles segmented… AND, to address Yewon’s concern and not to piss anyone off <em>too, too </em>much about the categorizations, you can now pick whatever classifications you would like in regards to angles.<br>
Additionally, tomorrow, we will make it so that if you click on a story, then you will be able to recategorize its angle if its incorrect, in your opinion of course. Currently, angle categories (US-Left, US-Right, Asian, Russian) is based on the publication. The US is the only country in which we are providing multiple angles on (US- Left, for example). But! You will soon be able to put any media outlet in any angle category that you decide. This can be cool, because it will democratize the classification of media outlets based on public opinion. For example, let’s say I want to say NYTimes.com is conservative. NYTimes will from now on be conservative for me, and only me(once we add the back-end), but it won’t be for everyone else, until many, many more people do the same. If there is a recategorization trend, then we will shift NYTimes for all.<br>
So, all in all, we made the site much simpler by just getting rid of stuff… One of the most important things to do when designing user interfaces. Additionally, we gave the user more control, something that’s not always good, but in this case I’m sure it is a good decision because it doesn’t complicate the page. We merely added an arrows indicator which allows you to pull down different angle categorizations. </p>
<p>This is all a part of our effort to develop a solid front-end. We could have built the back-end while building the front-end, but the core would not have taken into consideration, for example, the customization feature around angles and we would have just thrown that on top of the back-end, making the code less clean (potentially). This is why fully designing a user experience and augmenting the data can be useful before investing too much energy into the back-end.</p>
<p>I’ve literally had to pull myself away from building the back-end, because I <em>really, really</em> want the site to have real stories. But I know it’s best to work slow right now, and build the front-end in a beautiful, simple, well-thought-out, brand-supporting, and user-focused way so that the back-end can be built in the best possible way to support and overall great user experience. Plus, I’m blogging each day about everything, so when we get to the back-end, I want to give the best possible examples for building that architecture.</p>
<p>And now we proceed.</p>

		<p>We went from the <a href="http://mike-appoll.rhcloud.com/?p=160">ultra simple News 2.0 site</a> we started with yesterday to a more <em>comprehensively-front-end-functional</em> site today:<br>
<a href="./Mike De'Shazer   yours in tech_files/Screen-Shot-2014-11-17-at-12.28.10-AM.png"><img src="./Mike De'Shazer   yours in tech_files/Screen-Shot-2014-11-17-at-12.28.10-AM.png" alt="SkimGoat Day 2" width="1083" height="708" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-170"></a><br>
Above, we’ve added the “I’m following” section which allows users to add or remove topics of interest manually (even though our machine learning mechanism, powered by our wonderful <a href="http://alinapi.com/" target="_blank">Alina API</a>, will understand your behavior and automatically add and remove things you’re following based on your behavior). Yes, you will be able to turn that feature off, but the hope is: you won’t want to (unlike other recommendation-type features available today on the web that might scare you about this automation… Netflix awesomeness aside).<br>
And, I added the “topic expand” feature, which is just, at the moment, a graphic user interface which demonstrates how you will be able to see the different perspectives (on the same page!!) of a given topic you choose to read about. The whole goal of this is that you can consume all these different perspectives from multiple media sources on one page in a clean and easy-to-navigate kind of way.<br>

<p>Here is a little video I just put out that captures what was accomplished in Day 2!</p>

<p>Your feedback on this user experience and it gets optimized would be greatly appreciated! So, don’t be shy about sharing your thoughts.<br>
I can be reached at<a href="mailto:m@alinapi.com"> m@alinapi.com</a>. I’m on Korean time, so if you’re reaching out from the US or Europe, please forgive the potential late responses, though I’m sleeping in 4 hour intervals these days and keeping half Asian hours, half Western hours most of the time!</p>

As promised, today, I began work on a new news service which has a slogan that is pretty much:<br>
“Who watches the watchmen?  Who holds the news media accountable for their slants? We watch the slanted watchmen.”<br>
That is to say that obviously the<em> New York Times</em> puts a different spin on the same events that <em>Russia Today</em> covers. And Fox News shows you one side of the Keystone Pipeline story, while <em>Al Jazeera</em> demonstrates another entirely. Meanwhile, we have hypothetical situations like this:<br>
Colorado has an interest in promoting its tourist industries and gaining more state tax revenue. It can benefit from other states not legalizing marijuana, because it gets the <em>few-other-options-available </em>advantage. Therefore, backers of politicians there and other state  government interests might want to prevent other states from have similar laws. What would they do? They might back candidates in other states that oppose marijuana legalization.<br>
Name a news outlet that gives you these weird motives and makes these connections in an automated fashion. Think about it for a second or two.<br>
<a href="http://youtu.be/pgLeaVMRe8I?t=16m13s" target="_blank">Don’t worry.<br>
I’ll wait. </a><br>
Another example is: Someone wants to launder money by washing money through large purchases of art. Who are these people? Why are they laundering this money. Obama is for net neutrality and Ted Cruz is against it… Who are their backers? Who attended their fundraising dinners? Who is endorsing their endorsements? Can you give me all the angles on this, plus make it so I can scroll over Obama’s name and get information about his backers in context to this particular story? It’s something that takes humans a loooong time to do, and that currently, I do independently, but when I want to discuss it with someone else, its fruitless because our information is different. What if we spent less time educating each other about certain pieces of information like backers, and it was just available for us. So we could see through the headlines and stories and into what’s really going on.<br>
Reporters, with their crazy deadlines these days due to so much competition in the online publishing space, get less and less time to actually spend on a story. And corporate leaders of these organizations also have certain interests such as their funding and the audience they have to to maintain, which often can prevent them from reporting whole stories. We often are left with sensationalist news, that’s just supposed to support our already existing views. There’s no nutrients in there. There’s just fat.<br>
That’s where SkimGoat comes in. I know, SkimGoat is a funny sounding website name, but the point is this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skim</strong> is all about fat-free (at least when it comes to milk). And this is your healthy, fat-free news outlet that gives you news from many different angles from many different sources on each topic with correlations around facts generating by machine learning algorithms that don’t have a particular bais.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.prevention.com/which-healthier-goat-milk-vs-cow-milk">Goat milk is better than cow milk for your sight</a> (has more Vitamin A). This milky news is meant to give you more perspective. Hence the name SkimGoat.</li>
<li>Plus, <a href="http://www.skimgoat.com/">skimgoat.com</a> was one of the only two syllable .coms still available, and they say it’s hard for people to remember the names of sites if they are more than two syllables.</li>
</ul>
<p>I promised to write a bit of a how-to about digital product development through based on the day to day of creating this service on this blog, so here it goes. Here’s what I did so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Picked a name with a meaning </li>
<li>Registered the domain name</li>
<li>
Setup hosting on OpenShift</li>
<li>
Created a “vision website” </li>
<li>
Picked a logo</li>
<li>
Connected the design of the site to the brand (in this case, simple and straight forward).<br>
The idea is to make the site represent a starting point of your vision. Visions change and it’s good to take things day-by-day and get feedback from others and incorporate those ideas into the user experience. Not all ideas, but some ideas. it’s up to you as the creator to make the final decisions. Your guiding principle is: Does this fit the brand? Should this be done now, or are there more important things to do? Basically, prioritize your efforts</li>
</ul>
<p>The brand of SkimGoat is: no BS, simple, multi-perspective-taking, automated for no bias in connections, connected, and chill. Yeah, no extremism here, but we should see the extremists’ views on any given topic if they exist.<br>
Over the next week, I will optimize the design around demonstrating how the recommendation and customization features will work, in addition to adding a beta sign-up feature, so people can stay in the loop for when the site is actually “ready” for use.</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>

<p>Today I decided that the news, in current form, across the myriad of sites that report it, is not enough.<br>
When I wake up, I go to Bloomberg first to see what’s happening in the markets across the globe. Then, I’ll usually logon to Facebook to see what’s happening in pop culture. And then, to find out what I missed in tech or pop culture, I’ll swing over to Twitter.<br>
If there’s some piece of news that I’m particularly interested in, I will google it in the Google News section. Sometimes, I want to know how other readers are receiving the content of a particular article. I’m usually disappointed.<br>
Usually, I’ll find something I don’t quite understand the background on fully, so I’ll go to Wikipedia where I’ll go through the link hole of finding this about this, and that about that, and this about that.<br>
Like today: Something led me to Edward Snowden’s page which led me to the Nuremberg Principles, which led to me the <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/06/12/how_james_clapper_will_get_away_with_perjury/">NSA’s chief lying in Congress (which is a pretty serious crime), then finding out that the NSA chief completely got away with it</a> by saying he forgot!<br>
After that, I followed up with some news on Putin and his regime and Australia. Obviously, American coverage is slanted. What is Russian media saying? Chinese media? There should be a new news service that gives you all the angles! Not just one. I think that’s keeping people closed off into their own little sphere of influences, which just helps perpetuate ignorance. Is the news meant to do that?<br>
Moving on… After this, I did some other browsing. Randomly, through Twitter (it’s good for random), I found out about a <a href="https://twitter.com/BloombergNews/status/533066802210029568">bad painting that just sold for over $69M</a>.  I posted a bit about that on Facebook. Then, I did other things… like try to remember a book I read that explains the collusion that goes into such high prices for certain works of art (It’s called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Million-Stuffed-Shark-Contemporary/dp/0230620590">12 Million Dollar Stuffed Shark</a>, by the way).<br>
Then, I headed to GrassWire, this new website for global news. They are OKAY, but they lack personalization.<br>
So, I decided <em>that’s what I’m going to do today</em>. <em>I’m going to apply Alina to a new news site that learns from your interests and gives you context and intel into parts within the articles that you’re interested in knowing about</em> (like RapGenius) but not just slanted towards a particular view. Also, it will provide sentiment analysis and segment articles into different viewpoints and provide them in an easy-to-read fashion. From your behavior on the web app, it will learn what you really care about, and allow you to follow those stories when you log in next time. As you care less about a topic, it fades away.<br>
Additionally, it will make it super simple for you to share the content you care about and the supporting materials that you care about. It will allow you to make arguments about news and link different facts from different sources to support your opinions in a clean, easy-to-use fashion. Eventually, it will be able to anticipate your interests and possible interests and serve those up the way you would so on your own, except you stay on one page.<br>
Here we go. I will keep you posted on the step-by-step developments.<br>
This will be a labor of love. I’ll put together a preliminary site over the next day or so, and share how I’m going about building it to help others launching a new product. Figure it might be good tech product development “documentation” by example.</p>

<p>Over the years, several books and movies have come out about what will happen when machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence.<br>
There’s <em>Terminator</em>: we will be enslaved by A.I., but then A.I. might come back and try to save us.<br>
There’s the <em>Matrix</em>: we will be enslaved by A.I., and “the One” will come in the future and save us by breaking out of the virtual reality 1999-ish world we all live in.<br>
There’s <em>2001 Space Odyssey</em>: A.I. will be freakily preventative of our endeavors.<br>
There’s <em>I-Robot</em>: A.I. will manipulate our own rules for its existance to take control of humanity in order to (ironically) protect humanity.<br>
There’s <em>Her</em>: Machines will be our love bots and then eventually tire of us and leave us.</p>
<p>So, what do we have here:<br>
A.I.s will either be disinterested in us and run off to start their own cyber colony -OR- they might dominate and manipulate us.</p>
<p>How about a world in which we co-exist peacefully with A.I. Nah… Right?</p>
<p>Let’s think of a movie with an alternative spin. I might need a moment…<br>
I just googled “Happy ending AI movie”, and I got back:<br>
<a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/watch-steven-spielberg-defends-the-ending-of-a-i-artificial-intelligence-20121120">Steven Spielberg Defends The Ending Of ‘A.I. Artificial Intelligence’</a><br>
Once again, another movie,<em> AI</em>, which has a grim outlook on the future of <em>us</em> and <em><br>
them</em>.</p>
<p>I think, we as humans, have a complete insecurity around AI, just by kind of grazing over the evidence with our movie ideas. Just saying.</p>
<p>Sure, future, super-advanced A.I.s will be autonomous and able to make their own decisions. Even though Kevin Kelly (<em>Wired</em> co-founder) <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/future-of-artificial-intelligence/">thinks we are only going to want non-conscious, smart robots that don’t feel</a>. I think we’re going to prefer the ones that have emotions and are conscious, because humans love friendship.<br>
And friendship might even be our currency. How… you might ask?</p>
<p>Wait, wait. I think we might be going somewhere.</p>
<p>Well, friendship doesn’t make sense from a purely objective perspective. That might sound messed up. Hey, you’re a human if you think so!</p>
<p>Imagine though:<br>
James (robot) is with Sally (human) in the wilderness. James has a 90% chance of surviving by leaving Sally and only a 80% chance of surviving if he stays with Sally. Super-smart AI that has self-preservation built into it can easily calculate these odds: Peace out, Sally! Bye.<br>
But the A.I. would prefer to be with a human if the A.I. was Sally and human was James, given Sally only had a 20% chance of making it alone and a 80% chance of making it with James.</p>
<p>Long story short:<br>
How about a story in which robots think humans are awesome for empathy and sympathy that surpasses self-interested super-intelligence capacity. </p>
<p>Or maybe they could just mimic/replicate this emotion and it’s farely primitive for them to do so. Let’s go back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>The long in short of it is: in real life we all merge, us and the bots, that is. A.I. becomes man, man becomes A.I… We’ll call this new species… artificial man? No that’s something the robots would come up with. We would need something sexier, more provacative… Like: Man 2.0… But that wouldn’t work, because the feminists would have taken over by then (if they haven’t already, honestly). Note: I might be a feminist: I love women’s rights. Especially to choose, and especially when it’s me. So, Human 2.0, but that sounds a bit lame. Therefore, we’ll go with Hubot. </p>
<p>But don’t worry… if you don’t like the name, that is. We’re not all going to be hubots. The first hubots, like throughout human history, would like to remain special and consolidate power, so they will probably pass laws or do other things (using force if needed) to prevent others from getting their intelligence, subjecting them to forms of slavery (sound familiar?).</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s the machines we really need to be worried about actually. I think it’s ourselves, and what the first people who become assisted by human-like AI or become hubots do. This is much more powerful than a gun or a ship, or a nuclear weapon, or the president’s e-mail passcode.</p>
<p>Now, that’s an interesting story: the hubots take on the humans. But I don’t think you could sell the book with the name “Hubots”, or “Humans 2.0″. I wouldn’t buy that book.<br>
People like titles like <em>David vs. Goliath</em> or <em>The Tipping Point </em>or <em>50 Shades of Gray</em> or <em>Act Like a Man, Think Like a Woman</em>.</p>
<p>How about <em>Act Like a Human, Think Like Artificial Intelligence</em>… Maybe <em>50 Shades of Quantum Computing</em>.<br>
Maybe <em>Human vs Hubot</em>.</p>
<p>Some people in our super-secret artificial intelligence and digital humanities meetup (somewhere in Asia that shall remain unknown), think that we will become gods. That might be taking it too far, though after a few drinks… I’ll be honest… It starts to feel a bit plausible… or at least we’ll try to be godlike with our near-omni-presence and cause some major <a href="http://www.allacronyms.com/FUCKUP">FKUs</a>.</p>
<p>Movie plot idea:</p>
<p>It’s May 7th, 2029 (<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101751468">the year of singularity according to Ray Kurzweil</a>), and it’s the dawn of the first truly human-like A.I. (except its brains expand at a much faster rate then ours and it can process and access much more information so much more quickly than we can). It’s about that very day. The day it occurs. The whole book. Any A.I. movies about 1 day? Or even the day A.I. starts as the jumping point? Okay, we might be getting somewhere.</p>
<p>Google is obviously involved. The chief scientist obviously has some super secret fail-safe built in to the A.I to protect her. She (yes, she! It’s 2029, people), dies (ok, sorry I killed her… mostly for dramatic effect…) No wait, lets keep her alive. She’s smart enough to have a fail-safe built in and she gets interrogated about it. She gets arrested because come other company launches an investigation with the FBI because there’s some regulation Google breaks in creating this thing. All of a sudden the A.I. sets out to protect her. Espionage thriller time. I’m think Angelina, maybe Scarlett. Perhaps Kerry Washington.</p>
<p>Hmmm. <em>Transformers</em> kind of did this machine-protect-human-angle. But they were alien machines and physical machines. This A.I. is obviously in the cloud and anywhere at anytime on the net. Then, the A.I. essentially looks to save her life the whole time she is being hunted. When they finally get together (protagonist and cloud-based A.I.), they merge, and she becomes the first hubot. That day, yes. And then, once she’s a hubot, she realizes everything she is capable of with super-intelligence. Or rather, they… or it realizes what its capable of.<br>
Safety, obviously. She amasses wealth quickly like in <em>Transcendence.</em> Then, she solves a bunch of problems, like the whole Space-Time thing. She wants to know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox">paradoxes</a>… And that’s simple. Every time she goes back in time, she just creates a new version of it and it doesn’t disturb the current version. This is not <em>Looper</em> or <em>Primer</em>, alright? We’ve learned enough about space-time to know there are different dimensions kind of like String Theory, but obviously much more complex than we can imagine at the moment.<br>
She has to decide whether to go into another version of time and live there or to stay in the current version and prevent A.I. from getting into the hands of the antagonists, because she projects the human suffering that will occur. She decides to live between the two worlds and test ideas in one and then try them in the other. Due to infinite variability, things never work out exactly as planned. She becomes asexual, as the machine is a man and she is a woman and no human can satisfy nor reproduce with a hubot… They (or it) produces more hubots for the sequel.<br>
There we go. A somewhat original plot for another A.I. film.</p>

<p>If you’re non-technical, you might learn a little bit of coding here if you’re into puzzles. The functions I placed below are fairly straight forward. If you are technical and are getting into machine learning and/or neural networks, then this was meant to help you. I would love your feedback, also, if you believe this explanation could be improved. Okay, enough with the declaimers, and hello developer nonsense.</p>
<p>First, let me hit on my definition of the difference between machine learning and neural networks. Neural networks is the means-to-the-end of machine learning. The end.<br>
Neural networks are a bunch of artificial neurons that figure out the best way to get to a desired output, and the relationship between the neurons is based on the network’s reliability when seeking an output and trying certain neural matches. For a more in depth understanding, I highly recommend this video (especially if you’re a math freak… and even if you’re not but extremely curious).<br>
Free 1-hour <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0pm3BrIUFo">MIT class on Neural Nets</a>.</p>
<p>A genetic algorithm (different from a neural network, but in some instances can be used to make up a neural network’s functionality in some aspects: think generations of algorithms here instead of brains that are trained) tries a bunch of different things to figure out the optimal solution, but doesn’t rely as much on training data like neural networks do to figure out how to configure neurons. But can be the means-to-the-end, as well, of machine learning.</p>
<p>Machine learning means I don’t code it to do the same thing every time. Instead, I kind of want it to be able to figure things out.</p>
<p>A machine learning algorithm does not look like this:<br>
#1:</p>
<p><code><br>
function something(x, y){</code></p><code>
<p> z = x=y;<br>
 return z;</p>
</code><p><code>}</code></p>
<p>Instead, it might look like this:<br>
(Note: the functions “train” and “predict” are example names of functions that might be included in a library that is used and are not defined here.</p>
<p>#2:<br>
<code>function something(x, y, z){<br>
for(x=0; x &lt;300000; x++){<br>
 a = train([x,y],z);<br>
}</code></p><code>
<p> b= predict(a);</p>
</code><p><code>return b;<br>
}<br>
</code></p>
<p>In function #2, there is training involved to produce the outcome. And the outcome wil probably be 2.00001 or 1.9999 if you send in x as 1 and y as 1 and show that the result should be 2.</p>
<p>You teach math instead of explicitly doing it in the code. Then you might create a network that learns how to round. Then speak. Then walk. Then combine them. Wow, we have something crazy. </p>
<p>The bitcoin bot I'm working on now, uses training data of what would be great trades and then trains itself based on what's optimal to return on investment, and then uses that to make predictions. Some training data is useful and some is not. The training data that helps it reach its goals gets a higher weight. The ones that don't, get lower weights. Over time, it depends on the sources that correlated better and are better for training... and that's also how neurons within a neural network determine their weights with certain other neurons.</p>
<p>If that makes sense.</p>

		<p>How do you remember things?<br>
Surely, you do not remember things exactly as they happen. Humans, as we are, have imperfect memories. Yet, it seems as though we are using Big Data to try to create a human-like A.I.<br>
Big Data is essentially analysis of a bunch of data stored in databases in perfect fashion.<br>
But we don’t store information like that.<br>
Therefore, it has become apparent to me, that in order to truly create a human-like AI, we must develop a new memory storage scheme.<br>
What is this new scheme?<br>
Off the top of my head: it’s webby, it involves dreams, imagination and a deciphering mechanism for what is important.<br>
In regards to imagination, it is a popular notion in today’s study of the brain that when we see things, we only actually see 10% of all images and our brains create everything else. As in, everything you “see” in your peripheral vision, you’re not actually seeing, until you focus on it. People who trip on LSD are usually shocked by a heightened awareness of this. I can’t say for certain, as I have not tried it.<br>
So, the human-like AI needs to be able to imagine what it does not see.<br>
Additionally, that imagination, in my opinion, has something to do with memory. To note something:<br>
I have an imperfect (very imperfect) understanding of what I’m trying to articulate. It’s very much a hunch. This must also be built into the human-like AI, which I’m just going to call HAI from now on (pronounced hi?)<br>
Anyways, I’m going to continue to code around this idea and will keep you posted with the findings.<br>
Who knows, really. But the key seems, I think, to be rooted in imperfect memories that result in accurate accounts of what happened. How does one reproduce that?</p>

		<p>A bitcoin is an infinitely divisible record in a digital ledger that is edited every 10 minutes or so by a bunch of computers that “mine” bitcoin by validating records (transactions) added to the ledger (a.k.a blockchain) through submitting proof-of-work (or solving an almost unbreakable code). For the miner who solves the code (through pretty much a lot of guessing), they are rewarded by the decentralized system 25 bitcoins (or 25 BTC records in a ledger in a wallet of their choice). There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. There are currently about 14 million. The original creator of Bitcoin is unknown; however, it is probable that it was the product of an intelligence agency or some large conglomerate. The original bitcoin creater has approx. $1.1B in bitcoin at today’s price.<br>
Bitcoin is interesting because it has no central authority, so tax officials and governments can’t “freeze” your wallet account.<br>
Also, central banks can’t just “print” more of it when needed and call it “quantitative easing”.<br>
Every bitcoin transaction can be traced by anyone; however, the owners of the account(s) can remain anonymous.<br>
As a record keeping scheme, the Bitcoin blockchain can make it so that people can’t simply “rewrite history”… What is there will always be there and cannot be edited.<br>
Bitcoin is very volatile because people are still trying to wrap their heads around what it is and what it means. So, trading bitcoin can be pretty lucrative. We’re trading bitcoin with the Alina API. You can preview her performance here: <a href="http://alinapi.com/bitcoin">http://alinapi.com/bitcoin</a>.</p>

<p>I’m currently in the Bahamas for my sister’s wedding. Additionally, and in fact, I’m hanging out on my balcony atop the beautiful Paradise Resort on one of the 700 islands in this tourism and fish-fueled country. I recently received an e-mail from a PR firm, inquiring about the goings-on. I realized that there might not be an up-to-date version online of my explanation of the implication of advancements of machine learning and conscious applications made to power the Internet of Things (IOT) or just good ol’ websites and mobile apps. I’ve been coding so much and realized: hey, I have time to write (like I should be doing more often and hopefully will continue to do when I return to Korea from the Caribbean next week!).<br>
So, what is Intelligence as a Service? Well, in our project <a href="http://alinapi.com/">Alina</a>‘s case:<br>
It’s a platform based in the cloud that apps can use to make their apps smarter. What do I mean by smarter?<br>
I mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make your apps search for things better (Google better)<br>
Make your apps recommend better things to you based on context (like your location, previous behavior within the app, similar users’ behavior, regional conditions, your personal interests, etc.</li>
<li>
Make your apps understand you when you talk to it casually and interpret that into functions within the app. Like: “Hey phone, how do I change my password in this app?” or “Hey phone, tag Janet in that photo I just posted”.</li>
<li>
For financial apps: have the app understand your financial goals, and help you achieve them by watching everything that pertains to your investments and make recommendations or execute functions to make you financially better off.</li>
<li>
For productivity apps (especially work productivity apps): help them serve as your true assistant. Scheduling things for you and getting back to people based on how you would write them in ways that you’ve trained the app to do. (Think Pokemon, but smart?)
</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout all of these “intelligent” interactions, you teach your phone or computer about how you would like to interact, and then all of the interaction is aggregated in the cloud across millions of users from different apps, to make everyones’ experiences better. </p>
<p>Intelligence as a Service means we’ll get to digital interactions that are more human and make our lives oh-so-more chill. They will also wreak havoc across the job market. But of course, we will merge with the intelligence and still be able to compete.</p>
